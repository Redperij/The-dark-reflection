The 'Gallopists' foresaw the need for a new, rapid response capability to counter the recent rise in surprise Changeling incursions and infiltrations, and other, previously unanticipated, threats. Their initial light tank design, the Breezie, was very fast, but poorly armed and armoured. Never intended for a full scale war, delays in its replacement and increasing border incursions led to it being refined and produced in larger than planned numbers."
